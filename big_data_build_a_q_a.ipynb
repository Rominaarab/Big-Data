Although TPE is considered the standard approach, partial cystectomy (PC) may be a feasible option in selected patients. Oncological curability and satisfactory QoL may be achieved with appropriate patient selection. This study aimed to evaluate short-term outcomes and voiding-related QoL in patients with colorectal cancer and bladder invasion who underwent either PC or TPE at a single institution. Methods This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer and bladder invasion between May 2011 and February 2023 who underwent TPE or PC. Perioperative factors such as duration of surgery, blood loss, hospital stay, pathological outcomes, and short-term results were compared. In the PC group, postoperative urinary function was assessed using the Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), and IPSS-QoL. Results Twenty-two patients were included in this study, with eight and 14 patients in the PC and TPE groups, respectively. The duration of surgery and blood loss (p<0.001 and p=0.012, respectively) were lower in the PC group. Pathological curability and recurrence rates were not significantly different. In the PC group, the median pre- and postoperative IPSSs were 1 and 6, respectively; IPSS-QoL was 3.5 postoperatively. The median OABSS increased from 0.5 to 3.5. Median increases in IPSS and OABSS were 3 and 2, respectively. Conclusion With appropriate patient selection, PC may provide oncological outcomes comparable to those of TPE while better preserving postoperative QoL in patients with colorectal cancer and bladder invasion.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Fluconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatic toxicity, including fatalities primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions. In cases of fluconazole-associated hepatotoxicity, no obvious relationship to total daily dose, duration of therapy, sex, or age of the patient has been observed. Fluconazole hepatotoxicity has usually, but not always, been reversible on discontinuation of therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during fluconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Fluconazole should be discontinued if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to fluconazole. (2) Anaphylaxis: In rare cases, anaphylaxis has been reported. (3) Dermatologic: Exfoliative skin disorders during treatment with fluconazole have been reported. Fatal outcomes have been reported in patients with serious underlying diseases. Patients with deep seated fungal infections who develop rashes during treatment with fluconazole should be monitored closely and the drug discontinued if lesions progress. Fluconazole should be discontinued in patients treated for superficial fungal infection who develop a rash that may be attributed to fluconazole. (4) Potential for fetal harm: There are no adequate and well-controlled clinical trials of fluconazole in pregnant women. Case reports describe a pattern of distinct congenital anomalies in infants exposed in utero to high dose maternal fluconazole (400 to 800 mg/day) during most or all of the first trimester. These reported anomalies are similar to those seen in animal studies. If fluconazole is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking the drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus. Effective contraceptive measures should be considered in women of child-bearing potential who are being treated with fluconazole 400 to 800 mg/day and should continue throughout the treatment period and for approximately 1 week (5 to 6 half-lives) after the final dose. Epidemiological studies suggest a potential risk of spontaneous abortion and congenital abnormalities in infants whose mothers were treated with 150 mg of fluconazole as a single or repeated dose in the first trimester, but these epidemiological studies have limitations and these findings have not been confirmed in controlled clinical trials (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ).\",\n          \"WARNINGS Skin Cancer/Skin Aging Alert Spending time in the sun increases your risk of skin cancer and early skin aging.

Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer cells. Combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known which treatment regimen is more effective for multiple myeloma.\\n\\nPURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of melphalan, total-body irradiation, and peripheral stem cell transplantation with that of combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have previously untreated multiple myeloma.\",\n          \"Tecemotide (L-BLP25) is believed to induce a Mucinous glycoprotein 1 (MUC1)-specific T-cell response after vaccination. The primary purpose of this study is to ascertain whether vaccination with tecemotide (L-BLP25) induces a MUC1-specific T-cell response in slowly progressive or chemotherapy naive multiple myeloma subjects.\",\n          \"A chronic renal disease can results in the development of cardiovascular complications, including chronic arterial disease ; but a cardiovascular disease may be from a kidney malfunction that will end in end stage renal disease (ESRD). Two thirds of the chronic hemodialysis patients taken in charge in Grenoble in the last years suffered from an arterial disease at a symptomatic stage. Breakthrough pain can appear during the hemodialysis sessions. These sessions induce sudden hemodynamic changes and a peripheral vasoconstriction reaction that increases in particular all pain phenomena related to chronic low limbs ischemia. Therefore, patients have to face pain, sometimes chronic but also breakthrough pain, during the dialysis sessions, in all its dimensions.\\n\\nThe analgesic balance through the classical drug treatment is extremely complex, as they are both at risk of overdose and of partial effectiveness. Strict medical treatment remains unsatisfactory, as it takes into account only the expressions of symptoms during dialysis sessions, when most of the time pain is already installed and analgesic treatment is not completely effective.\\n\\nThe combination of classic pharmacological treatment with hypnosis, already used in other indications (chronic pain, analgesia, depression and anxiety), may mitigate the painful feeling on patients suffering from arterial disease during the dialysis sessions, with a beneficial impact on their overall quality of life. There is also evidence to suggest that hypnosis may be more effective treating neuropathic or vascular pain, those experienced by our patients, than musculoskeletal pain, like back pain.\\n\\nHypnosis is a mind-body approach focused on the subject, and not on the disease or the act of dialysis. It can be described at the same time as a modified state of consciousness and a particular intersubjective relation between a practitioner and his patient. The practice of this kind of hypnoanalgesia by the nurses is particularly relevant in hemodialysis, as the trust developed during regular chronic treatment can become an asset to shorten the induction phase and help to install this intersubjective relation.\\n\\nThe high incidence of this complication, the difficulties of current pain management and the impact on everyday life for the patients, justify the choice of this approach, where more further research is needed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
